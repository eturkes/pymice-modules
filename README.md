# PyMICE Modules

PyMICE Modules is dedicated to the development of PyMICE *paradigms*, high-level
routines as simple as calculating corner visits to analyzing following behaviors.
Addition of statistical and figure generation methods, as well as miscellaneous
utilities also go here. The goal is to establish a standardized API for working with the
upstream PyMICE library. This has the potential of making the analysis pipeline highly
modular, which will offer the user great flexibility in creating custom pipelines and
implementing tools and techniques from third-party projects.
