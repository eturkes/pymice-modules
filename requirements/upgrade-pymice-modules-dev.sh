# This script keeps the pymice-analyzer conda env up-to-date. It first upgrades all
# conda packages and then all pip packages. To help ensure the most important packages
# stay at the highest version possible, we upgrade them manually after upgrading all of
# the packages. pip is also upgraded manually because conda keeps it at an unusually
# old version.

# Call the script using ". ./upgrade-pymice-analyzer-dev.sh". Note the first dot, this
# is necessary to make conda available by executing the script in the current shell.
